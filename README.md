- 👋 Hi, I’m @Plentk
- 👀 I’m interested in networks (graph theory😮), history & cartography (specifically transportation systems)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a better person, leader, communicator
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you want me to. Just reach out for me!
- 📫 How to reach me: extend your long arms and tap me on the back. I will respond as soon as possible if action is done.
- 🇸🇬 Proud (and Complaining) Singaporean
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🐦 Fun fact 1: never ask me to distinguish between different bird species (crow vs mynah)
